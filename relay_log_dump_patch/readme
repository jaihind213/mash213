This patch allows a client to request Relay Log dump from the server.

the git difference is between 60100a2b70c386dd109b97aded9ead924747fdd4  and  0e9cfe3762371cc31772782f9335814b9d38e437

Note:
----
Since the server automatically deletes relay log when the changes have been applied. 
make sure you have 'relay_log_purge=FALSE' in your my.cnf
and 
make sure you take care of purging relay logs i.e. like using a cron
